  <h1 class="post-title">R Meeting 2013 in Lyon</h1>
  <span class="post-date">29 Jun 2013</span>
  <p><img class="centered" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3768/11464124943_c3cee2c2ea_c.jpg" /></p>

<p>I just came back from beautiful Lyon (France) after attending the 
<a href="http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/" target="_target">Deuxième Rencontres R</a> 
(2nd French R meeting, June 27-28). </p>

<!--more-->

<p>The meeting was kindly organized by 
<a href="http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/members/dray/" target="_blank">Stéphane Dray</a> and 
<a href="http://r2013-lyon.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/4" target="_blank">company</a>, 
and hosted by l&#39;Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1.</p>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3729/11464114433_b71149f9e4.jpg" /></p>

<p>The main goal of this type of R meeting is to get together <em>la cRéme de la cRéme</em> in 
France working with R. Among some of the popular names you may have heard of: Romain 
François, Christophe Genolini, Karim Chine, Francois Husson, and Jérôme Sueur 
(just to name a few).</p>

<h3>Visualising big data in R (by Hadley Wickham)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3775/11464002044_4afdf36de5.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://had.co.nz/" target="_blank">Hadley Wickham</a>, now chief scientist 
at Rstudio, was the keynote speaker and he delighted us with his presentation on 
<a href="https://github.com/hadley/bigvis" target="_target">bigvis</a>. Briefly, the 
main idea behind the package bigvis is to provide exploratory visualization tools for 
very big large datasets (10-100 million observations).</p>

<h3>L&#39;analyse des données avec FactoMineR (by François Husson)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2810/11464077156_75c6c6dd60.jpg" /></p>

<p>For those of us interested in data analysis tools, 
<a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/membres/Francois.Husson" target="_blank">François Husson</a> 
gave a presentation with some of the new improvements around the popular package 
<a href="http://factominer.free.fr/" target="_blank">FactoMineR</a> by the nice team 
at <a href="http://math.agrocampus-ouest.fr/infoglueDeliverLive/" target="_target">Applied Mathematic Department, Agrocampus Ouest</a> 
in Rennes.</p>

<h3>KmL3D: K-means pour données longitudinales jointes (by Christophe Genolini)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5546/11464002464_de90984561_o.jpg" /></p>

<p>Among other speakers, we had the chance to listen to 
<a href="http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/" target="_blank">Christophe Genolini</a> 
who showed us the package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kml3d/index.html" target="_blank">KmL3D</a>. 
For the French community, if you are not familiar with Christophe, you should check 
his <a href="http://christophe.genolini.free.fr/webTutorial/index.php" target="_blank">tutorials</a> 
on creating R packages. Especially interesting for programming with S4 classes.</p>

<h3>Intégration R et C++ avec Rcpp (by Romain François)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2885/11464115053_aa0195c75e_o.jpg" /></p>

<p>Romain François, the guy behind <a href="http://gallery.r-enthusiasts.com/" target="_blank">R Graph Gallery</a>, 
gave a short presentation about the renowned package 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html" target="_blank">Rcpp</a>. 
His slides were interesting, but what caught my attention was a the fact that he was 
using his smartphone to switch slides. Later I asked what he used and he told me it was 
the keynote app (which I think can be very useful!) Yes, you need wifi to synchronize 
your mac and your iphone but then you have the freedom to move around the stage.</p>

<h3>R and the Cloud (by Karim Chine)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="/images/blog/elasticr.png" /></p>

<p>Another very interesting talk was given by Karim Chine about 
<a href="http://www.elastic-r.net/" target="_blank">Elastic-R</a>. My main complain is 
that a one hour talk may not be enough to show all the really cool stuff you can do with 
R and cloud computing. It is my opinion but I think Karim deserves his own R meeting, 
or at least a couple of workshop sessions.</p>

<h3>R as a sound system (by Jérôme Sueur)</h3>

<p><img class="centered" src="/images/blog/seewave.png" /></p>

<p>Although I didn&#39;t take a picture of 
<a href="http://sueur.jerome.perso.neuf.fr/" target="_blank">Jérôme Sueur</a> 
(I was not close enough), his presentation was by far the best presentation of the 
entire meeting. He gave an illuminating talk on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioacoustics" target="_blank">bioacoustics</a> 
and some of the packages that R offers to analyze sounds and acoustic data (see his R 
package <a href="http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave/" target="_blank">seewave</a>).</p>

<p>I asked him if he was planning to share his slides. He told me that if the meeting 
organizers didn&#39;t share them, he would eventually upload the presentation to his website. 
In any case, I really hope he (or the meeting organizers) get to share the slides so you 
can check his awesome work. What I liked the most about his talk was the notion of 
<em>Sonification</em>, which is the analogy of visualization but instead of visual cues to 
represent data you use sounds to listen to data (ain&#39;t that cool?)</p>
