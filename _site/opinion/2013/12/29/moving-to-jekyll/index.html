  <p>After two weeks of hacking and consulting forums, tutorials and posts, I&#39;m launching my 
new jekyll-powered website. </p>

<h3>Goodbye Google sites and wordpress</h3>

<p>So far I had been using <a href="http://www.google.com/sites/help/intl/en/overview.html">google sites</a> 
to host my personal website, and <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/">wordpress</a> for blogging. </p>

<p>Both <em>google sites</em> and <em>wordpress</em> allow you to have a free website/weblog in a very 
accessible way. They both have basic themes and simple gui&#39;s that don&#39;t require you 
to program a single line of code... which is really good if you are an illiterate web 
programmer like me. I even recommend them to my students and colleagues to start 
having an online presence besides the typical social network profile.</p>

<p>What I liked the most about <em>google sites</em> is that all my google products (presentations, 
docs, tables, drive, plus, picasa, youtube, etc) could be integrated in a painless way. 
In addition, the learning curve was very mellow and I gained enough confidence to start 
playing with <em>html</em> format and other less basic options. However, as I started to learn 
more about html and css, I felt very limited with the provided options of <em>google sites</em>. 
That was the main reason why I started to look for other more flexible alternatives.</p>

<p>On the <em>wordpress</em> side, I think it is as good as <em>google sites</em> if you want to have a basic 
weblog. Of course you can also install the more advanced and customizable version, but 
that requires you to spend more time learning the nitty gritty stuff.</p>

<p>What I learned so far is that having two sites is not the most brilliant idea. It wasn&#39;t 
that terrible but my blog was cannibalizing my site. And another drawback was that I had 
to maintain two intertwined products. So the obvious question was: Why not having 
everything in one single place?</p>

<h3>Why Jekyll?</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember when was the first time I heard about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a>. 
I even tried it long time ago but I got a bit scared with all the options and files that 
I needed to modify in order to have a running static stie. </p>

<p>However, the more jekyll-based sites I saw, the more I felt drawn to give it one more try. 
Among several reasons, these are the ones I felt more attracted to (and intrigued by):</p>

<ul>
<li>No need to use databases </li>
<li>Can work with simple plain text files (e.g. <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a>) </li>
<li>Free hosting with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
<li>Possibility to <a href="http://jfisher-usgs.github.io/r/2012/07/03/knitr-jekyll/">blog with knitr-generated</a> files </li>
</ul>

<h3>Jekyll Tutorials</h3>

<p>I won&#39;t lie to you: it wasn&#39;t easy for me to start with <em>jekyll</em>... but it wasn&#39;t 
impossible either. It required a good dosis of patience, and a lot of hours a day looking 
for information, tutorials, forums, and examples on how to build a website with <em>jekyll</em>. 
It also required me a lot of experimenting, iterations, and going through a couple of 
very frustrating moments wondering what was wrong when something didn&#39;t work as expected 
(although this happens to me every time I&#39;m learning something new).</p>

<p>The good news is that you can have a basic <em>jekyll</em> default template in an almost 
immediate way. This template is the one used by <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">Tom Preston-Werner</a>. 
If you like this option, then you are ready to go. However, I bet you will want to have 
a different design. In case you need some inspiration there is a list of 
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/sites">Jekyll-powered blogs</a> that you can take a 
look at. I strongly encourage you to check them since you also have access to their 
source code.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a short list of tutorials I found useful (of course, you can find many more links 
out there and even some youtube videos)</p>

Boettiger</li>
<li><a href="http://klepas.org/jekyll-a-static-site-generator/">Jekyll, a static site generator</a> by 
Pascal Klein</li>
<li><a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Blogs</a> by Jade Dominguez (this is based on Jekyll 
Bootstrap but it contains a lot of useful details for using Jekyll)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Good to know</h3>

<p>It&#39;s hard to give a list of all the things you&#39;ll need to get started with <em>jekyll</em>. It 
all depends on your experience building and developing weblogs, and how adventurous you 
feel to try new things. For those like me with a limited background here is my 
checklist of some concepts and tools to know about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">jekyll installation</a></li>
<li>installing <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a></li>
<li>installing <a href="http://rubygems.org/pages/download">RubyGems</a></li>
<li>working with <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> text formatting</li>
<li>free hosting with <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></li>
</ul>
