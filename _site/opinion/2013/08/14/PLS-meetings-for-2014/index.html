  <span class="post-date">14 Aug 2013</span>
  <p>For those of you interested and working around the fascinating world of Partial Least 
Squares, you should prepare for next year&#39;s (2014) meetings:</p>

<h3><a title="pls14" href="http://www.pls14.org/" target="_blank">www.pls14.org</a></h3>

<p>The 8th International Symposium on PLS and Related Methods (PLS&#39;14), to take place on 
May 26th-28th, 2014 in Paris (France). </p>

<h3><a title="plsas14" href="http://plsas.net/" target="_blank">plsas.net</a></h3>

<p>2014 PLS Applications Symposium to take place in Montreal, Canada from 30 May - 1 June 2014 (Friday - Sunday). </p>

<h4>PLS 2014 meetings</h4>

<p>Some of you already know about my involvement with Partial Least Squares (PLS) data 
analysis methods. For those of you who don&#39;t, I must say that one of my research areas 
has to do with PLS stuff. Anyway, the important thing is that next year (2014) looks 
very exciting for the PLS community with two important meetings: 
<a title="pls14" href="http://www.pls14.org/" target="_blank">PLS14</a> (Paris) and 
<a title="plsas14" href="http://plsas.net/" target="_blank">2014-PLSAS</a> (Montreal).</p>

<p>Both conferences are organized independently from each other. PLS14 can be said to be 
the <em>traditional</em> conference, being the 8th edition. It is open to the broad 
family of PLS methods, and related techniques. It encourages submissions related to 
Management, Social Sciences, Chemometrics, Sensory Analysis, Industry and Life Sciences 
including Genomics.</p>

<p>2014 PLS Applications Symposium is more limited than PLS14, focused on PLS-based SEM 
in general (i.e. PLS Path Modeling). It looks that PLSAS-2014 is more north-american 
based (although this is just my personal impression).</p>

<p>Personally, the fact of having two almost-parallel PLS meetings, reflects the success 
of PLS techniques, the interest among researchers, and its increasing popularity. </p>

<p>So which conference to go? It would be cool to go to both conferences but that looks 
extremely expensive. It&#39;s hard to tell which one you should go. I guess the answer 
heavily depends on your budget, and also in your research area. To be honest, they are 
not cheap (at least if you are student). I wish both organizing committees would offer 
more attractive discounts or scholarships for students and young researchers. Both 
meetings seem good opportunities to know people in the PLS community, do some networking, 
and keep updated with the last trends and state-of-the-art.</p>
