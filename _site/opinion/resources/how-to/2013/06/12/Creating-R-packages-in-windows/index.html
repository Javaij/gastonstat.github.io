  <span class="post-date">12 Jun 2013</span>
  <p><img class="centered" src="/images/blog/be_creator.png" /></p>

<p>This post is dedicated for those <strong>useRs</strong> interested in becoming <em>creatoRs</em>, especially 
those working under windows. Here are the slides of my workshop 
<a href="http://www.gastonsanchez.com/teaching" target="_blank">&quot;Create your first R package (in windows)&quot;</a>.</p>

<h3>Becoming a creatoR</h3>

<p>Every year more and more R packages are developed and shared among the R community. It 
has been amazing to see the exponential growth of packages contributed to CRAN in the 
last five years (or so). Moreover, the availability of tools for making the developers&#39; 
life easier has been incredible (eg <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html" target="_blank">devtools</a>, 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/testthat/index.html" target="_blank">testthat</a>, 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html" target="_blank">roxygen2</a>, 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html" target="_blank">rd2roxygen</a>, 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/knitr/index.html" target="_blank">knitr</a>)</p>

<p>With all these <a href="http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/" target="_blank">trends</a> 
it would be tempting to say that now anybody can quickly switch from being just a 
<strong>useR</strong> to being a <strong>creatoR</strong>. How hard can it be? Well, the truth is that for 
many <em>useRs</em>, creating an R package is still a dream. Especially if you have very 
limited programming experience, or if you just have a basic knowledge of R, creating an 
R package on your own can be a truly challenge that will put your patience to the test. 
And on top of that, is even worse if you are working on windows: sooner or later it becomes 
a fu#$ing nightmare.</p>

<p>I learned how to develop R packages on my own. And to be honest, it was a very 
frustrating experience. Moreover, most people I know that have developed R packages, 
have gone through the same burden I went through.  </p>

<p>I still remember my first failed attempts to make an R package and how demoralizing it 
was. I used to think that the only reason why I wasn&#39;t able to create an R package was 
simply because I was just a very bad apprentice (i.e. stupid). I don&#39;t have any data 
about the number of people that have learned how to create R packages by themselves, 
but I would like to think that we are the big majority.</p>

<p>I know we all can have access to the manual <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.pdf" target="_blank">Writing R Extensions</a> 
(by R Core Team). This manual is the official source of information containing all the 
details on how to create a package in R. By the way, I don&#39;t like the name of the manual. 
I would simply call it &quot;Creating R Packages&quot; (but that&#39;s a personal opinion). Virtually 
everything you want to know is there. The problem is that, admittedly, the manual is NOT 
beginner friendly whatsoever.</p>

<p>There are many tutorials and documents available online dedicated to show how we can 
create R packages. But since I just recently gave a workshop on this topic, I decided 
to add my two cents. So in this post I&#39;m sharing my slides (and other material) under 
the series: <a href="/teaching/rpackaging">Create your first R package (in windows)</a>. 
Here&#39;s the list of discussed topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction</li>
<li>Part 1: Setting up your PC</li>
<li>Part 2: Anatomy of an R package</li>
<li>Part 3: Standard development</li>
<li>Part 4: Building and Checking</li>
<li>Part 5: Develop smarter, not harder</li>
</ul>

<p>The aim of the slide materials is to give you a basic description of the development 
process. I don&#39;t pretend to cover everything, just enough so you can have a starting 
point. But hopefully these slides can help you avoid some useless R packaging suffering. 
The goal is to help you make the transition from being just a <em>useR</em>, to start 
being a <em>creatoR</em>.</p>
