  <h1 class="post-title">A book for a PLS Saga</h1>
  <span class="post-date">31 Mar 2015</span>
  <p>In September of last year I started to prepare some teaching material about Partial Least Squares methods. And of course I also thought about including a couple of sections about the history and evolution of such techniques.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This wasn&#39;t the first time I was writing about the story behind PLS. I had previously written a chapter on this subject for my PhD Dissertation, and I had also included an appendix in my book <strong>PLS Path Modeling with R</strong>. However, this time I wanted to write something a little bit different. I knew I didn&#39;t want to list again the same material I had published before. But I wasn&#39;t quite sure about what to do this time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, it didn&#39;t take me long to come up with some ideas. At the end, I decided to write the content in a narrative style (i.e. my weird attempt to imitate a historic novel writing format). And so I pushed myself to be the narrator of the long series of events that have shaped the path traveled by PLS methods.</p>

<p>What I didn&#39;t have in mind was to come up with a separate publication for the historical content. My original plan---until very recently---was to put that content next to the technical stuff (theory, equations, algebra, examples, case studies, etc).</p>

<p>About three weeks ago I had one of those <em>Eureka</em> moments of inspiration. I guess some synapsis fired in my neurons that made me change plans. &quot;What if I split the historical content and put it in a separate manuscript?&quot; On the one hand, that part of the material was almost finished. On the other hand, I could experiment with creating a book entirely readable online (which is something I had been wanting to do for a long time).</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much right now, but I can definitely tell you that I&#39;m very excited for this new project. Coming really soon ... <em>a saga of PLS</em>.</p>
