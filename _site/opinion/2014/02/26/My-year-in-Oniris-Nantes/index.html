  <h1 class="post-title">A year in Oniris-Nantes</h1>
  <span class="post-date">26 Feb 2014</span>
  <p>It has been almost one year since I&#39;ve been in the <em>Unit of Sensometrics and Chemometrics</em>, at 
Oniris-Nantes. So I feel it&#39;s time to look back in retrospect and do a quick review of activities.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><img class="centered" src="/images/blog/elephant.jpg" /></p>

<p><em>What&#39;s this photo?</em> Glad you asked. It&#39;s the famous <strong>great elephant</strong> from 
<a href="%22http://www.lesmachines-nantes.fr/%E2%80%8E%22">Les Machines de l&#39;ile</a> de Nantes. A colosal machine of
12 meters high and 8 meters wide, made from 45 tons of wood and steel.</p>

<h3>A very personal post</h3>

<p>In the fall of 2012 I received an invitation from Mohamed Hanafi to come to Oniris and 
collaborate with him doing research on multiblock data analysis methods. I gladly accepted 
his invitation and I moved to Nantes (France) in the spring of 2013.</p>

<p>To be honest, not everything has been fun, awesome, wonderful and cool as I expected. But 
overall, I cannot complain. As my wife says, it&#39;s important to have a positive mind and 
look at things from the bright side. So yes, this post it&#39;s definitely more for me than 
for my readers, friends, and colleagues. And its main purpose is to help me keep track 
of some of the stuff I&#39;ve done in the last 12 months.</p>

<h3>Oniris-Nantes</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.oniris-nantes.fr/recherche/departements-et-unites-de-recherche/unite-sensometrie-et-chimiometrie/">
<img class="centered" src="http://www.oniris-nantes.fr/fileadmin/templates/Oniris/v1/img/logo.jpg" />
</a></p>

<p>I won&#39;t blame you if you know nothing about Oniris. Before coming here, I didn&#39;t know 
anything about it either. Briefly, Oniris is just the weird non-sense yet official name of the
<em>École National Vétérinaire, Agroalimentaire et de l&#39;Alimentation</em> (formerly known as ENITIAA). 
In simple terms, Oniris is the veterinary and food science school of Nantes.</p>

<p>On the food science side, there&#39;s the <em>Unit of Sensometrics and Chemometrics</em> (USC) in 
charge of Mostafa Qannari. This is where I&#39;ve been working as a research engineer, trying 
to develop a computational ecosystem in R for multiblock statistical methods. Also, I&#39;ve 
been mentoring the graduate students in the stats program, giving seminars for the 
master students, and sharing tips with other professors. Last but not least, I&#39;ve also 
had the chance to partner again with my italian friends in Paris.</p>

<h3>My 2nd book</h3>

<p>Outside of my job duties, I was able to finish <a href="/Handling_and_Processing_Strings_in_R.pdf">Handling and Processing Strings in R</a>, 
my second ebook so far. I don&#39;t know how many people have read it (or downloaded it). 
However, I appreciate a lot the few emails I have received from a handful 
of readers. Thanks to all of them for their critics, for helping me catching a couple of bugs, 
and for helping me spreading the news about the ebook.</p>

<h3>R packages</h3>

<p>As part of my day-to-day activities, I have been doing a lot programming and R packaging. 
Among the several packages that I&#39;ve been working on, there are three of them that are 
fully operational (although not all of them in CRAN). In case of doubt, you can always 
install the latest versions from my <a href="https://github.com/gastonstat/">github repositories</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>tester</code></li>
<li><code>turner</code></li>
<li><code>matrixkit</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Likewise, I&#39;ve been able to constantly visit <a href="http://cnam.academia.edu/GiorgioRussolillo">Giorgio Russolillo</a>
and pick up again the non-metric PLS features and added them to the package <code>plspm</code>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also proud of having contributed to the completion of two R packages developed by my 
colleagues at USC: <code>multigroup</code> and <code>ClustVarLV</code>. The package 
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/multigroup/index.html">multigroup</a> (by Aida Eslami <em>et al</em>) 
provides methods for multigroup data analysis, and it is one of the derived outputs 
from Aida Eslami&#39;s phd project. In turn, the package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ClustVarLV/index.html">ClustVarLV</a> 
(by Evelyn Vigneau and Mingkun Chen) provides methods for clustering 
of variables around latent variables.</p>

<h3>Pending stuff</h3>

<p>There are several things in my to-do list. I&#39;ve tried but failed to convince my colleagues 
to use the R package <code>knitr</code> for creating documents from within R. I just hope it 
doesn&#39;t take them too long to see the advantages and convenience of avoiding copy-pasting 
while preparing their documents and beamer slides.</p>

<p>Also unfinished is my attempt to change their style for making presentations and slides. 
I know I&#39;m swimming upstream on this issue, but I don&#39;t want to lose my hope yet. The 
truth is that it is easier to influence the new generations than the old ones.</p>

<h3>Last remarks</h3>

<p>At a more personal level, I was able to migrate my website to github pages and jekyll! 
And of course, I&#39;ve improved my French (although it is still very far from being perfect). 
Last but not least, I&#39;ve diminished my intolerance to red wine, reduced my aversion to 
cloudy-rainy weather, increased my preference for ciders and galettes, and discovered 
the wonders of Breton salted-butter.</p>

<p>I wish I could stay more time in France but I must go back to California. This year in 
Nantes has been a very enriching experience and I feel very lucky of having being invited 
to Oniris. What&#39;s next? I have no idea, but I&#39;m looking forward for my next journey. 
As the Nantes&#39; motto says: <strong>Favet Neptunus Eunti</strong> (Neptune favours the traveller). </p>
