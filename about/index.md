### In the beginning

My professional tale begins in the late 1990s when I attended Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM) 
for my undergrad studies. That's where I obtained a B.S. degree in [Actuarial Science](http://departamentodeactuaria.itam.mx/es) in 2002 with a thesis on what was at that time a very novel topic: 
_Cluster Analysis Applied to Web Mining_. Among other secrets, that's where I got my first contact with [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (version 1.2!).

Being an actuary (designing insurances, pension plans, and other risk management products) can be very interesting and fascinating... but it wasn't for me. Trying to redeem myself from my misfit college years, I went to work as a junior analyst at the [National Banking and Securities Commission](http://www.cnbv.gob.mx/en/Paginas/default.aspx) (CNBV) auditing and analyzing credit unions in Mexico. But then I found out that bureaucracy wasn't for me either.

Despite my bittersweet experience with government institutions, I started my professional experience in the banking and finance industry with a lot of motivation and eagerness. Between 2002 and 2003 I got two advanced certificates from [ITAM](http://desarrolloejecutivo.itam.mx/extension/html/cont-oegeneral.aspx?cvecon=1&origen=Pagina): one in Credit and Banking, and another one in Brokerage Finance. I could have kept going in that direction but then a painful existential crisis forced me to take a step back. Ignoring the general advice to go for an MBA-like degree, I followed a hunch and decided to pursue a graduate degree in statistics.


### Graduate Years

Fate conspired to take me to Barcelona and so I moved there in 2004 to enter the graduate program in the department of [Statistics and Operations Research](https://www.eio.upc.edu/en) at the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC). I finished my masters degree in statistics in 2006 with a focus on multivariate methods for data analysis, and then I took a leap of faith when I chose to go after the whole PhD enchilada. 

During my years as a grad student I worked at the 
[Laboratory of Information Analysis and Modeling (LIAM)](http://recerca.upc.edu/liam/) 
where I did a lot of research and statistical programming... all of this inside a lab in a basement with no sunlight and very few distractions (something crucial if you want to finish a dissertation on time). I also did a fair amount of consulting, mostly with survey studies and marketing analytics projects.

In 2007 I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant with [Adrian Done](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-done-32196941) in the Operations Department at [IESE Business School](http://www.iese.edu/en/programs/by-campus/barcelona/) (Barcelona), this time working in a building with an [awesome view](http://www.accessmba.com/uploads/tx_templavoila/IESE_FT.PNG) of the entire city. 

In 2009 I successfully completed my PhD in Statistics under the guidance of my sensei [Prof. Tomas Aluja](https://recerca.upc.edu/liam/menu1/tomas-aluja) with a dissertation on [Segmentation Trees in Partial Least Squares Path Modeling](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3b9gfy5w45a4xcr/pathmox-approach-thesis-gaston-sanchez.pdf) (I know dissertation titles are horrible, but it’s not as abstract as it sounds).


### Research and Postdocs

After finishing my PhD I moved to California in 2010, not because I was following the American dream but because I was following the woman of my dreams (whom I eventually married). I also took a break from academia to do some freelance statistics consulting and start experimenting with a personal website and blog.

At the beginning of 2011 I went back to academia and started collaborating with the [Biology Scholars Program (BSP)](http://bsp.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley where I provided statistical consulting until the end of 2012.

In June 2011 I began a postdoc in [Rasmus Nielsen's Lab](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/) working on statistical genetics and association studies. This was a very enriching experience that broaden my skills, forced me to recycle myself, and made me think outside and inside the box.

Also, from August 2011 until July 2012 I became affiliated with the [Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment (PRHE)](http://prhe.ucsf.edu/prhe/) at UC San Francisco where I worked as a part-time consultant.

In the Spring of 2013, I moved to Nantes, France, for a second postdoc as a research engineer in the [Unit of Chemometrics and Sensometrics](http://www.oniris-nantes.fr/en/research/research-units/research-unit-sensometrics-chemometrics/unit-presentation/), at Oniris-Nantes where I worked with Mohamed Hanafi on a series of prototype R packages for multiblock methods.

Back in the US I returned to the Nielsen Lab for the Spring of 2014, and then I became an [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) fellow during that summer, working on a web product for scoring cosmetic and personal care products.


### Lecturing

In 2015 I became affiliated with the Math Department at Berkeley City College, as well as the Department of Statitics at the University of California Berkeley.`


### Overall

In the last 10+ years I've been spending my time working on a number of projects, most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing and visualizing data in a context of multiple variables and high dimensionality. 

This means that I've been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for association-relationship between multiple sets of variables (i.e. multiblock data) using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. psychometrics, chemometrics, sensometrics, econometrics, ecology and biometrics).

In particular, I've done a lot of programming and development of software for statistical computations, graphics, and data analysis. Behind all the stuff that I’ve done there is a single idea and goal: 
**to build a succinct summary of the data I'm analyzing**.


### Other Stuff

I haven't always been interested in statistics and data analysis. My goal in life when I was younger had nothing to do with what I do now. When I was a teenager what I really-truly wanted was to be a professional swimmer. More precisely, I wanted to spend my life swimming long distance races and be paid for that (what an awesome job that would be).

My other great hobby-passion has to do with mountaineering and outdoors activities. I eve wrote a book (in Spanish) about the theoretical fundamentals of rope techniques: [Fundamentos Teoricos de Maniobras con Cuerdas](https://leanpub.com/ftmcebook)

From time to time, the right hemisphere of my brain rebels over the left one, and my captive poet scribbles some 
[random poems](http://gastonsanchez.com/poemar) in Spanish, and my inside [Rtist](http://gastonsanchez.com/Rtist) produces weird paintings.

# About this website

This website is my personal space where I try to declutter my ideas and put my 
projects in order. This is easier said than done.
  
- It only happens after many iterations and refinements
- During days and nights in front of a computer
- Fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea
- Sometimes listening to music, sometimes in silence
