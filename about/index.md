# About 

I am a Lecturer in the [Department of Statistics](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/) at the University of California Berkeley; Lecturer in the [Math Department](http://www.berkeleycitycollege.edu/wp/math/) at Berkeley City College; developer of various R [packages](/software), and founder of [plsmodeling.com](http://plsmodeling.com).

I received a BS in [Actuarial Science](http://departamentodeactuaria.itam.mx/es) in 2001, from the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico (ITAM), and a PhD in [Statistics](https://www.eio.upc.edu/en) in 2009, from the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC), under the supervision of [Tomas Aluja](https://recerca.upc.edu/liam/menu1/tomas-aluja). I was a postdoctoral researcher with Rasmus Nielsen at the [Nielsen Group](http://cteg.berkeley.edu/~nielsen/), 2011-2013. After that I was a research engineer at the [Unit of Chemometrics and Sensometric](http://www.oniris-nantes.fr/en/research/research-units/research-unit-sensometrics-chemometrics/unit-presentation/) (USC), Oniris-France 2013-2014. In the summer of 2014 I was an [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com/) fellow.

In the last 9+ years I've been spending my time working on a number of projects, most of them with the central theme of exploring, analyzing and visualizing data in a context of multiple variables and high dimensionality. 

This means that I've been revisiting the core concepts behind methods for association-relationship between multiple sets of variables (i.e. multiblock data) using different approaches from a broad range of disciplines (e.g. psychometrics, chemometrics, sensometrics, econometrics, ecology and biometrics).

In particular, I've done a lot of programming and development of software for statistical computations, graphics, and data analysis. Behind all the stuff that Iâ€™ve done there is a single idea and goal: 
**to build a succinct summary of the data I'm analyzing**.

# About this website

This website is my personal space where I try to declutter my ideas and put my 
projects in order. This is easier said than done.
  
- It only happens after many iterations and refinements
- During days and nights in front of a computer
- Fueled by dozens of cups of coffee and tea
- Sometimes listening to music, sometimes in silence
